## Front end Developer
A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer. Front-end developers create the user interface (UI) that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look.

Sample code:
```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")
